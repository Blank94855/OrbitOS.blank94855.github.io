- **Introducing the Lock Screen**  
  The system now features a dedicated Lock Screen upon boot, providing stronger "security" and a clean entry point into the OS.

- **Fluid Animations**  
  A comprehensive set of new animations across the UI. Windows open and close with a smooth, snappy motion, making the entire experience feel modern and responsive.

- **Expanded Font Library**  
  Personalize your terminal! Choose from **15 unique monospace fonts** for greater customization.

- **Graphical System Information (fastfetch)**  
  Running `fastfetch` now launches a dedicated, movable window with detailed system specs, including build number, kernel version, and simulated hardware info.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features & Utilities
- **Integrated Media and Video Player**  
  Built-in, draggable media and video players that stay in the corner of the screen. Sleek, modern design.

- **Smarter Commands**  
  - `wiki <query>` ‚Üí fetches and displays article summaries directly in the terminal.  
  - No need to open a browser tab!


- **Persistent Note-Taking**  
  Manage your thoughts directly from the terminal:  
  - `notes add`  
  - `notes view`  
  - `notes delete`

---

## üõ† Platform Stability
- **Better Mobile Support**  
  Vastly improved compatibility for touch devices. The terminal adjusts correctly when the on-screen keyboard is opened, keeping the input area always visible.

- **BIOS & Error Handling**  
  New `bios` command provides access to system functions. Fatal errors now trigger a clean and aesthetic **Blue Screen of Death** that matches the OS style.

- **Full Data Persistence**  
  Your custom username, chosen font, and login history are now **saved reliably between sessions** using cookies.
