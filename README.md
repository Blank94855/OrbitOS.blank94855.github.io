  Personalize your terminal! Choose from **15 unique monospace fonts** for greater customization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features & Utilities
- **Integrated Media and Video Player**  
  Built-in, draggable media and video players that stay in the corner of the screen. Sleek, modern design.

- **Smarter Commands**  
  - `wiki <query>` ‚Üí fetches and displays article summaries directly in the terminal.  
  - No need to open a browser tab!


- **Persistent Note-Taking**  
  Manage your thoughts directly from the terminal:  
  - `notes add`  
  - `notes view`  
  - `notes delete`

## üõ† Platform Stability

  Vastly improved compatibility for touch devices. The terminal adjusts correctly when the on-screen keyboard is opened, keeping the input area always visible.

  New `bios` command provides access to system functions. Fatal errors now trigger a clean and aesthetic **Blue Screen of Death** that matches the OS style.
